# lecturelighter Chrome Extension

Make lectures easier and faster to watch by removing the silent parts. There's a version hosted on [Github Pages](https://cabalex.github.io/lecturelighter) if you want to try it out without installing an extension.

## Building
Clone the project, do `npm install`, and then `npm run build`. It should build the extension to the `build/` folder, which you can then run unpacked in the `chrome://extensions` menu (though remember to toggle the developer mode switch on first).
